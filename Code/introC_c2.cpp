/*
Open the code1.c file you have in this directory.
You will see two functions:  max and main.

In max, the algorithm is written as comments, but there is no code.
You should translate this algorithm to code.

In main, there are three print statements which call max and print
its result.  These would let you check if max is working right.

There is also a comment asking you to write one more print statement
with a call to max.  In that comment, it asks you to take the max
of two numbers (written as hex), and print them out.
Add a line of code to do this.

When you have done this, run

./test.sh

This script will try to compile your code (which you will learn about in
the next chapter), as well as run it.   If your code does not have legal
syntax, it will do its best to describe what is wrong.  If there
is a problem, look at the code and try to see where you did not follow
the syntax rules from chapter 2.  The line number and message it gives
may help you find the problem.  If you cannot find the problem after a minute
or two, ask for help.

If your code has legal syntax, test.sh will also run it, and show
you the output it produced, as well as the output we expected.

If they are the same, you should commit, push, and grade.

If they are not, you should see if you can fix the problem (and ask for help
if you cannot).




After launching the Practice Programming Environment, move into the 03_code2 folder to begin the assignment.

$​ cd learn2prog/03_code2

I​n this folder you will find a README file that contains instructions for the assignment. Don't foget to add your file(s) to git, commit and push, and then run the grade command to pass this assignment.

I​MPORTANT NOTE:
I​f you did not pass the previous assignment (02_code1) then you won't see the 03_code2 folder with this assignment. Complete the previous assignment before attempting this assignment.

W​e strongly encourage you to do the assignments in order, as each assignment builds on previous assignments, and you need to pass all assignments to pass this course. If you didn't pass the previous assignment but really want to work on this assignment, you can release it using the command:

$ fast-forward 03_code2

Open the code2.c file you have in this directory.
You will see two functions:  printTriangle and main.

As with the previous problem, the printTriangle function
has an algorithm written as comments, but there is no code.
You should translate this algorithm to code.

In main, there are three print statements which print out a triangle
with height 4, and the total number of stars in that triangle (returned
by the printTriangle function).

There is also a comment asking you to write a few more statements
to do the same thing for a triangle of height 7.
Add the code to do this.



For this assignment, you will be practicing writing, compiling, and
running code.  You should write a C file, called hello.c, with a main
function that uses the printf function to print the message

Hello World

[be sure to include a newline!]

Your program should return EXIT_SUCCESS to indicate that it was successful
(the return value of main indicates success [0] or failure [anything else]).

Don't forget to include stdio.h (for printf) and stdlib.h (for
EXIT_SUCCESS).

When you are done, compile your code and run it.
